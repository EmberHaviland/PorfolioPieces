These files are for varying aspects of a Poker project I made for a Technical Design course. 
This was using an action list hierarchy to organize a lot of moving pieces, which in this case are cards. 
There is no game, so much as just demonstrating the way things move around between states using the action list.

Things I'm particularly proud of:
- Menu effects. The menu employs multiple little visual effects 
  to demonstrate things and feels/looks good as a result.
- Overall use of Action list. This, while being a situational 
  way to orient the logic, was very useful for this type of game, 
  and it allowed me to see a different way of viewing problem 
  solving when implementing things with different tech design methods.
