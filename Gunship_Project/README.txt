These are files for varying aspects of a game I created in Unity, and my first independant attempt
at gameplay programming/technical design. It's a top down bullet hell with little drone enemies
that spawn around the player, as well as a train boss. The boss's whole gimmick is that the train car
in front of any chain is the "engine car" and can control the train, whilst the others just shoot
at the player with a variety of bullets, some of which apply an effect to the player, such as 
inverting their controls and EMPing them. If the player destroys a car and separates the train in two,
they both operate independantly, and continue in different directions.

Things I'm particularly proud of:
- Train boss. The idea of it was my own, and the implementation 
  was surprisingly effective despite being made up on the spot
- Overall feel of flying around, the camera follows the player well,
  and the player movement feels appropriate to the selected airship.
- The bullet effects. The effects they apply create a fun element that spices
  up the variety between train boss cars loadouts.
