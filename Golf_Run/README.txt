These files are for varying aspects of my current independant project: A golf game where the hole runs away from you. 
So far the hole does not run away from the player, as I've been focusing on honing in how the gameplay feels.

Some things I'm particularly proud of:
- The dynamic fluid camera(using cinemachine/custom mouse weight logic)
- Line signifiers and overall interaction with the ball
- Overall feel of the gameplay(Through playtests and iteration)
